# BOChaMM
**B**ayesian **O**ptimisation for the **Cha**racterisation of **M**ixed **M**odes.

### This branch includes all data for the entire sample. Please use the other branch if you are interested in the code but do not want to download everything (i.e., peakbagged modes, samples from BayesOpt).

## Accessing the code and repository

### This branch includes all data for the entire sample. Run the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jsk389/BOChaMM.git --branch main --single-branch
```

### If you do not want to download all data products (i.e., peakbagged modes, samples from BayesOpt), access the alternate branch by running the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jsk389/BOChaMM.git --branch devel --single-branch
```


The following schematic demonstrates the optimization procedures involved in BoCHaMM.

BOChaMM uses the [TuRBO](https://github.com/uber-research/TuRBO) algorithm for optimization, with a quick preview on how it applies to the PSxPS task shown in the following:
