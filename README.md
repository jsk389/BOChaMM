# BOChaMM
**B**ayesian **O**ptimisation for the **Cha**racterisation of **M**ixed **M**odes.

### This branch includes all data for the entire sample. Please use the other branch if you are interested in the code but do not want to download everything (i.e., peakbagged modes, samples from BayesOpt).

The following schematic demonstrates the optimization procedures involved in BoCHaMM.

BOChaMM uses the [TuRBO](https://github.com/uber-research/TuRBO) algorithm for optimization, with a quick preview on how it applies to the PSxPS task shown in the following:

**TODO:**

**Do we want to include a section in Part 2 notebook about doing mode ID?**

**Finish write up**
