# BOChaMM
**B**ayesian **O**ptimisation for the **Cha**racterisation of **M**ixed **M**odes.

## This branch contains four example stars from our sample. Use this branch if you are interested in the code but do not want to download all the data (i.e., peakbagged modes, samples from BayesOpt) that is present in the other branch.

The following schematic demonstrates the optimization procedures involved in BoCHaMM.

BOChaMM uses the [TuRBO](https://github.com/uber-research/TuRBO) algorithm for optimization, with a quick preview on how it applies to the PSxPS task shown in the following:

**TODO:**

**Do we want to include a section in Part 2 notebook about doing mode ID?**

**Finish write up**

**Binder notebook example**
